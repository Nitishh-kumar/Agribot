# Agribot
It is a multipurpose agricultural robot which can perform five different operations like ploughing, seeding ,cutting ,sprinkling, levelling.

# Abstract

The Discovery of Agriculture is the first big step towards civilized life, advancement of agricultural tools is the basic trend of agricultural improvement. The qualitative approach of this project is to develop a system which minimizes the working cost and also reduces the time for digging operation and seed sowing operation by using automation. It is designed to minimize the labor of farmers in addition to increasing the speed and accuracy of the work. It performs the elementary functions involved in farming i.e. ploughing the field, sowing of seeds and covering the seeds with soil. This prototype can navigate it on any agricultural land and perform seed sowing operation simultaneously. Autonomous agriculture robot is one of the promising solutions for precision agriculture.

# Problem Statement
